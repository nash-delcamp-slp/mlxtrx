\arguments{
\item{db_conn}{A database connection object inheriting from \code{DBIObject}.
Defaults to a connection created by \code{default_db_conn()}.}

\item{include_files}{Logical scalar. Whether to include details about input and
output files in the data. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

each project file. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include_summary}{Logical scalar. Whether to include information from the
